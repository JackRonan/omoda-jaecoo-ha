# Omoda / Jaecoo → Home Assistant

🌐 **English** · [Italiano](README.it.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG-en.md) · [Original Changelog (it)](CHANGELOG.md)

## English Fork & Localization Notes

This repository is an English translation and localization fork of the original Italian integration created by [@Caslinovich](https://github.com/Caslinovich/omoda_jaecoo-ha).

### Important Tips
* **Delegated Account (Recommended):** To maintain access to the official mobile app simultaneously, it is highly recommended to create a second account (requires a spare phone number) and delegate vehicle access to it, using that second account for this integration. Logging in with the same account on both Home Assistant and the official app will cause session logs/tokens to repeatedly kick you out of the official app.

### Model Compatibility
* **Omoda E5 & Omoda / Jaecoo**: This integration is tested and verified to work with the **Omoda E5** (in the UK) as well as the **Omoda / Jaecoo** (according to the original author).
* **Chery App Similarity**: The Omoda / Jaecoo app is code-similar to the Chery app. It is likely that other Chery-app based vehicles are supported (though untested as they use different endpoints and certificates).
* **All Omoda/Jaecoo Models**: In general, this integration should work with all models compatible with the official Omoda / Jaecoo app, though you may need to manually disable some entities depending on your individual vehicle's features.

Bring your **Omoda / Jaecoo** car into **Home Assistant**: vehicle status,
location and commands — just like the official app, but integrated into HA.

> ✅ **Ready to use.** All you need to get started is the **email + PIN** of your
> Omoda/Jaecoo account (plus a **one-time OTP code** received by email on first
> login). VIN and certificates are detected and installed **automatically**. The
> package contains **no personal data**: tokens and credentials stay only in
> *your* Home Assistant.

> ⚠️ **UNOFFICIAL software**, reverse-engineered. Not affiliated with Omoda /
> Jaecoo / Chery. Provided "as is", use at your own risk and only on your own
> vehicle. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).



## What you can do

- **Car status** — doors, locks, trunk, hood, windows, roof, climate, seat
  heating/ventilation and more, as HA entities.
- **Location / GPS** — a button locates the car (`device_tracker` + location
  sensors), even while parked.
- **Battery, speed, range, mileage** — update automatically when the car is
  **driving or charging**; during charging the monitor follows the progress.
- **Commands** — buttons for climate, locate, wake-up and more, that actually act
  on the car.
- **Notifications** — optional blueprint for an alert when a command fails.

## Installation

1. **HACS → ⋮ menu → Custom repositories** → add this repo's URL, category
   **Integration**.
2. Search for **Omoda / Jaecoo** → **Download** → **restart Home Assistant**.
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Omoda / Jaecoo**.

## First login

Everything happens **inside Home Assistant**, no external tools:

1. Enter your account **email** and **PIN** (regional endpoints are optional,
   Europe by default). HA sends an **OTP code** to your email.
2. Enter the **OTP code** → HA creates the session and discovers your vehicles.
3. If you have multiple cars, pick the **VIN**; if there's only one it is added
   directly, with all its entities.

If the session later expires (usually because you opened the official app), use
the **"Request OTP code" / "Confirm OTP"** buttons (with the "OTP code" text
entity) to log back in without reconfiguring anything.

## Daily use

- **Don't open the official app** while the integration is active: same account →
  they disconnect each other (and a new OTP may be required).
- Many entities are `unknown` while the car is in **standby** (this is normal);
  after an HA restart they show the last known value.
- Battery, speed and mileage only update when the car is **driving or charging**.
  For an immediate reading while parked there's the **"Refresh full status"**
  button, which turns on the climate for ~1 minute to wake the car, then turns it
  off again.

## Updating

When a new version is released: **HACS → Omoda / Jaecoo → Update → restart Home
Assistant**. The change history is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Notifications when a command fails (optional)

The integration only provides the entities: it **doesn't send notifications on
its own**. If you want a **popup when a command to the car fails** (vehicle busy,
unreachable, expired session…), import the included blueprint:

[![Import the blueprint into Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJackRonan%2Fomoda-jaecoo-ha%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fomoda_jaecoo%2Ffailed_command.yaml)

Then **Settings → Automations → Create automation → From blueprint → _Omoda /
Jaecoo — Failed command alert_**. It recognizes only real failures (it ignores ✅
and ⏳), so no false alarms.

## If something doesn't work

1. **Diagnostics (recommended):** **Settings → Devices & Services → Omoda /
   Jaecoo → ⋮ → Download diagnostics**. It is **already anonymized** (email, PIN,
   VIN, tUserId and GPS redacted; tokens/certificates show only "present:
   yes/no") → safe to share in an
   [issue](https://github.com/JackRonan/omoda_jaecoo-ha/issues).
2. **Detailed logs:** same page → **⋮ → Enable debug logging** → reproduce the
   problem → **Disable debug logging**: HA downloads the log. PIN, OTP and tokens
   are **never written to the logs**; the only possibly sensitive value is the
   **VIN** (the diagnostics from step 1 already hide it).

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0+ with HACS.
- An Omoda/Jaecoo account with the vehicle associated (owner).
- A local MQTT broker is **not** needed: the integration connects to the car's
  cloud **on its own**.

# Under the hood (technical)

Everything below is **automatic**: it's here only to understand the flow, for
debugging, or to bring the integration to a region not yet covered. In a normal
install **nothing needs to be run by hand**.

### 1. Login and token (OTP)

The first login mints a per-account **session token** from email + PIN + OTP.
Chain orchestrated by the config flow (code in
`custom_components/omoda_jaecoo/core/`):

| Step | Module | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| send OTP | `login_omoda.py invia <email>` | solves the gateway captcha (§2) and triggers the code by **email** |
| mint token | `prova_token.py <email> <code>` | calls `/auth/oauth2/token` replicating the app (SM4 encryption) and saves the token |
| orchestration | `session.py` | exposes `request_otp()` / `confirm_otp(code)` / `check()` / `refresh()` |

The token ends up in **`<config>/omoda_jaecoo_<VIN>_token.json`** (never in the repo).
As long as the **refresh_token** is valid, `session.refresh()` renews the session
**without** a new OTP. A new OTP is needed only if both token and refresh die —
typical case: **opening the official app** (single session on the cloud side).

### 2. Captcha (slider) — solved inside Home Assistant

Sending the OTP is protected by a **slider captcha**. `captcha_solver.py` solves
it **in-process** with **only `numpy` + `Pillow`** (cross-correlation and
morphology reimplemented from scratch, **no OpenCV**): so it works even on **Home
Assistant OS** (musllinux, where `opencv-python-headless` has no wheel). No user
interaction, no heavy dependencies.

### 3. Mutual-TLS MQTT certificates — auto-provisioning

Telemetry connects to the car's **EMQX** broker over **mutual-TLS**. The client
certificates (`ca.pem`, `client.pem`, `client.key`) are **universal per-region
constants** — **identical for all users**, taken from the APK's **public**
assets — **not** per-account data: account isolation comes from the MQTT
username/password and the topic ACLs, exactly like the official app.

On first start `coordinator.async_provision_certs()` deobfuscates the certs from
the bundle (`custom_components/omoda_jaecoo/certs/store.json`) and writes them to
**`<config>/omoda_jaecoo_<VIN>_certs/`**. Manual override: the **`certs_src`** field in
the config flow. For a region **not** present in the bundle, startup fails with a
message indicating where to put the certs.

### 4. Command provisioning (car_token)

Sending commands requires a per-vehicle **car_token** (not the BFF `userToken`).
Chain replicated from the app, handled by `commands.py`:

```
getTuserId → loginTSP (= car_token) → queryList → setVecDefault(vin)
           → checkPassword(PIN, scene) → command   (Authorization = car_token)
```

The **PIN** is the account's. ⚠️ A **wrong** PIN risks **locking out** the
account: it must not be guessed. The VIN must be among the authorized vehicles
(`authorizeType` 2 = owner, 0 = delegate). `provision.py` provides a
**read-only diagnostic** (`diagnose()`) that checks vehicle membership and
`authorizeType` **without touching the car**.

### Generated files (in your HA, never in the repo)

- `<config>/omoda_jaecoo_<VIN>_token.json` — per-account session token.
- `<config>/omoda_jaecoo_<VIN>_certs/` — mutual-TLS certificates for the MQTT broker.

Covered by `.gitignore`, they never leave your installation.

### Manual provisioning / login (advanced, outside HA)

For debugging you can use the CLI scripts in `custom_components/omoda_jaecoo/core/`
with a Python that has the manifest `requirements`, configuring the environment
via variables (see [`omoda_jaecoo.env.example`](omoda_jaecoo.env.example)):

```bash
# 1) send the OTP code by email (solves the captcha)
python3 login_omoda.py invia <email>

# 2) mint the token and save it in $OMODA_TOKEN_PATH (default ./token.json)
python3 prova_token.py <email> <code>

# 3) (optional) vehicle/authorization diagnostic — READ-ONLY
python3 provision.py
```

The token minted this way is the **same** file the integration reads: by pointing
`OMODA_TOKEN_PATH` at `<config>/omoda_jaecoo_<VIN>_token.json` you can unblock a setup
even without redoing the OTP from the config flow.
